# Print Center Project Setup Guide

## üöÄ Getting Started with GitHub Project Management

### 1. Create Development Branch
```bash
# From your current main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create and switch to develop branch
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop

# Set develop as default branch for PRs (in GitHub settings)
```

### 2. Set Up GitHub Project Board

#### Create Project Board
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Projects" tab
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose "Board" template
5. Name: "Print Center Development"

#### Add Columns
- üìã **Backlog** - All planned features
- üèóÔ∏è **In Progress** - Currently being worked on  
- üëÄ **In Review** - Pull requests under review
- ‚úÖ **Done** - Completed features
- üöÄ **Released** - Deployed to production

### 3. Create Milestones

#### Milestone 1: MVP Phase 1 - Core System
- **Due Date:** 3 weeks from start
- **Description:** Core print request functionality with basic admin management
- **Goals:** Database setup, file upload, request submission, basic admin queue

#### Milestone 2: MVP Phase 2 - Enhanced Features  
- **Due Date:** 6 weeks from start
- **Description:** Real-time notifications, full admin dashboard, user management
- **Goals:** WebSocket notifications, email system, enhanced admin interface

#### Milestone 3: Production Release
- **Due Date:** 9 weeks from start
- **Description:** Analytics, advanced features, performance optimization
- **Goals:** Reporting, bulk operations, system optimization

### 4. Create Labels

#### Priority Labels
```
priority-critical - #d73a49 (red)
priority-high - #f66a0a (orange) 
priority-medium - #fbca04 (yellow)
priority-low - #0e8a16 (green)
```

#### Type Labels
```
enhancement - #a2eeef (light blue)
bug - #d73a49 (red)
documentation - #0075ca (blue)
maintenance - #fef2c0 (light yellow)
security - #b60205 (dark red)
performance - #5319e7 (purple)
```

#### Component Labels
```
database - #1d76db (blue)
api - #0052cc (dark blue)
frontend - #e99695 (pink)
file-upload - #f9d0c4 (peach)
notifications - #c5def5 (light blue)
admin - #d4c5f9 (light purple)
auth - #bfd4f2 (light blue)
workflow - #c2e0c6 (light green)
```

### 5. Create Issues from GITHUB_ISSUES.md

Copy each issue from the GITHUB_ISSUES.md file and create them in GitHub with:
- Proper title and description
- Appropriate labels
- Assigned milestone
- Add to project board in "Backlog" column

### 6. Set Up Branch Protection Rules

#### For `main` branch:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Include administrators in restrictions

#### For `develop` branch:
- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging

### 7. Configure GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline is already set up in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Update your `package.json` to include the required scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix",
    "build": "echo 'Build step placeholder'",
    "audit": "npm audit --audit-level moderate"
  }
}
```

### 8. Development Workflow

#### Starting a New Feature
```bash
# Always start from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/database-setup

# Work on feature...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add database schema and models"

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/database-setup

# Create Pull Request: feature/database-setup ‚Üí develop
```

#### Code Review Process
1. Create PR with proper template filled out
2. Request review from team members
3. Address review comments
4. Merge after approval and CI passes
5. Delete feature branch after merge

#### Release Process
```bash
# When develop is ready for release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop
git tag -a v2.0.0-alpha.1 -m "Print Center MVP Alpha 1"
git push origin main --tags
```
